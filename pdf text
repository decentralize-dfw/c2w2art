Final Monologue 

A 30-Minute Browser-Based Metaverse Experience 

Page 4

Click to Wear 2: Collection + Runway 

Touch, the touch of Adam, or the message that came to Muhammad through the act of reading. 

These are gestures that appeal to the senses, forming the foundation of being human, and they are also the roots of the empirical knowledge we possess today. 

Touch, reading, wars, inventions, kingdoms, nations, stories. At the end of all of these, humankind has evolved into the era of the click. 

Knowledge once acquired through touch is now absorbed by tapping a digital screen or clicking a mouse. 

With a single click you can earn billions, lose everything, infect your computer with a virus and lose all your work, or by clicking and scrolling through what you read, possible to reconstruct yourself from scratch. 

Creator's note, Intro Paragraph 

Page 6

Humanity evolves from touch to click, from atom to code, transforming knowledge and identity. 

In that transmission phase, via design, C2W2 Runway tells a six-chapter story about our relationship with tech: 

Concept Summary 

Page 7

how it first changes art, 

then devalues it through mass production, and finally forces a search for new meaning and identity. 

The click is the new biology. 

Page 8

C2W2 is a 30-minute browser-based runway. 

Out of seventy-five, selected forty-eight avatars appear in a six-chapter sequence, with hyper-real textile simulations and a clear narrative spine. 

Overview 

Page 9

The work merges digital fashion, architecture, and performance into one continuous environment. 

Each chapter marks a step in the evolution of identity, material, and medium in virtual culture. 

Overview 

Page 10

This 30-minute experience marks the first time ever that a metaverse experience itself has been directly minted (not as a trailer or asset, but as the work in its entirety) and can be watched straight from OpenSea or any browser window. 

No download, no login. 

Page 11

The runway is a minted .html application on Ethereum. 

Through its animation URL, the show can be experienced in three different ways: a marketplace version with 3 fixed cameras, a desktop version that allows users to move freely during the show, and a VR version. 

All three are packed into the same link. 

World Insights 

Page 12

The metaverse space is a minimalist, dark environment with dramatic circular lighting, evoking a digital void where avatars evolve. 

Avatars rotate 360 degrees and walk in 15 meter radius loops during 30 seconds each, and each has a central object related to the design. 

World Insights 

Page 13

Each chapter builds on the last: starting with AI-reimagined art classics, shifting to experimental digital fashion, blending NFTs and figures, resetting with pure AI generation, ascending minimally, and rebirth through transformed echoes.

Runway Parts 

Page 16

The runway begins with the avatarization of paintings (as one of the most traditional mediums) war figurative masters, whose designs aims to recapture the essence through this new dimension. 

part 1: Evolution Of Medium Of Traditional Art 

Page 17

The second part explores the variations of digital fashion and design on flat avatars, probing their limits and experimenting with different personalities. 

part 2: Virtual Fashion 

Page 18

The third chapter is a hybrid of the first two as a historical continuation where NFTs and notable figures merge with digital design, creating a deeper conceptual terrain. 

Especially in a reality where familiar figures are reinterpreted within this new context, the weight of the message lightens, and the viewer no longer watches something cool, but falls into the meaning itself. 

Visual Text: "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US", "COME AND TAK IT", "SEIZE THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION" 

part 3: Evolution Of Medium Of Art As Nft 

Page 19

In the fourth chapter, much like what the internet and AI did to us initially, the prior three parts are effectively reset. 

Through avatars generated entirely by AI, the runway erases and devalues everything we saw before. 

This mirrors the cheapening of cool visuals under the flood of AI-produced imagery, where hand-made labor loses its aura. 

part 4: Ai Powered Design 

Page 20

The fifth chapter sanctifies, in a minimalist way, the identity-dissolving nature of these new design possibilities, both for the designer and the user. 

Drawing on small references from the earlier chapters, it stages a kind of parametric, historical ascension, like the most sacred of avatars or the salvation of humanity itself. 

It evokes the loneliness of the individual after the material bombardment of chapter four, in search of meaning. 


part 5: Transhumanism 

Page 21

The final chapter shows no new avatar. Like a phoenix rising from its ashes, the runway closes with the rebirth of an idea, an institution, or perhaps anything at all. 

Strategically selected avatars from the previous five parts return, but altered: recognizable yet transformed. 

Unlike the recycled revival of 90s denim or 2000s looks, this is a deeper return to essence: not nostalgia, but a fragmented transformation of a simulated century condensed into thirty minutes. 

Here, the core theme is not the avatars or the clothes themselves, but the multidimensional narrative of AI, the metaverse, blockchain, belonging, and identity.

Component: Textile Physics Fidelity, 3D Asset Optimization, Rendering Efficiency, Visual Aesthetic Control, Cross Platform Compatibility. 

Method & Impact: Utilizes DRACO and Meshopt. The 48 garments were designed and simulated using Clo3D. 

C2W2 is the first time ultra-realistic, dynamic textile physics from Clo3D has been successfully streamed and rendered as a complete 3D exhibit within a standard web browser environment. 

All 3D models (GLB/VRM) are heavily optimized using DRACO Compression and Meshopt. 

This ensures that despite the detail, individual file sizes range from 0.5MB - 20MB (averaging 5MB), facilitating a seamless real-time stream. 

The entire scene is fine-tuned for minimal resource strain, running consistently with just 1 to 3 Draw Calls (max 3). 

Custom WebGL / Three.js rendering provides total control over visual fidelity... 

Integration with WebXR delivers a native Virtual Reality experience when viewed on a compatible headset... 

Technology & Performance 

Page 25

The core of the C2W2 avatar collection lies in its uncompromising pursuit of hyper-realism in digital material. 

%80 of the fashion pieces featured in the runway were designed, patterned, and simulated using Clo3D... 

This simulation captures the authentic weight, drape, and movement of the fabric. 

Through optimization and Three.js rendering, C2W2 exhibits these complex, high-fidelity textile simulations within the simple environment of a web browser. 

The collection explores a dichotomy between familiar and alien materials: ultra-realistic denim and cotton coexist with high-gloss chrome, random memes, fluid metal, transparent glass, mouse painted captions, and the concept of "invisibility." 

In C2W2, the simulated fabric is as vital to the agent's identity as their animated walk.

The C2W2 acquisition represents more than collecting a finished artwork; it is securing the genesis artifact of a new era of digital performance. 

Owning the Genesis 

Page 28

This 30-minute narrative is the first historical instance of a full, complex metaverse experience being directly minted as a single, watchable, executable NFT. 

The work defines the Spatial Web as an independent and collectible medium. 

Minting the entire Dream 

Page 29

This approach eliminates platform dependency, ensuring the artwork is instantly viewable from any browser, including directly within OpenSea, thereby guaranteeing its accessibility and functionality for perpetuity. 

Free-for-all 

Page 30

To ensure the artwork's survival beyond any single platform, the entire project ecosystem is secured on the permanent archival layer of Arweave, accessible via the Ethereum blockchain. 

Perpetuity and Provenance 

Page 31

The core HTML file, the complete set of PFADI assets (models, environment models), and all audio/text files are secured on Arweave (via Ethereum transactions). 

This robust archival solution ensures that the artwork is permanently preserved and censorship-resistant. 

Even if external hosting services fail, the work's components remain verifiable by any individual or institution globally. 

Perpetuity and Provenance 

Page 32

To guarantee the collector granular provenance and ownership over the artistic process, C2W2 establishes a dual-collection structure. 

PFADI is the secondary collection where all foundational assets are cataloged and minted separately. 

PFADI includes every sound file and every optimized 3D model used in the show, providing the collector or archivist with irrefutable proof of ownership of all original building blocks. 

Post Flesh Architecture Dream Index 

Page 33

Upon acquisition, the collector secures perpetual rights and the full, verifiable archive of the complete 30-minute narrative performance and the entire PFADI asset index, guaranteeing the work's lasting cultural and market value.

Unlike complex digital installations, C2W2 is engineered for seamless, low-overhead presentation across diverse exhibition environments. 

VR Headset (Exhibition Mode: Immersive VR): The full, navigable WebXR experience allows viewers to walk freely alongside the agents... 


Touchscreen Monitor / Tablet (via iframe) (Exhibition Mode: Interactive Display): The fixed-camera iframe version is ideal for non-intrusive gallery kiosks. 


High-Resolution Monitor / Projector (Exhibition Mode: Cinematic Loop): A pre-recorded, multi-camera edited video... offers a polished, cinematic presentation for passive viewing areas. 


Any Web Browser (Exhibition Mode: On-Chain Access): Viewable directly from the NFT token on platforms like OpenSea... 


Versatility for Any Venue 

Page 35

The C2W2 experience is set to a bespoke soundtrack, deeply integrated into the narrative flow of the six chapters. 

The music is not incidental; it is designed to underscore the themes of technological evolution, digital identity, and cultural appropriation. 

All audio tracks and sound files are permanently archived within the PFADI collection...

C2W2 is an organic transmission of the human-digital metamorphosis, documenting the complex evolution of existence into the era of the Click. 

Creatoe's Note / Meditation 

Page 37

The runway structure itself serves as a cultural commentary. It is a three-dimensional reimagining of our daily habit of scrolling vertically through endless, thirty-second social clips (like TikTok or YouTube Shorts). 

This mathematics, which drives the algorithm's content feed, is strategically implemented beneath the runway, anticipating the future of online experience. 

30 seconds, and next. 

The TikTok Vertical Feed 

Page 38

We are heading toward a world where every person and company will have autonomous agents communicating and transacting on their behalf. 

The avatar is the necessary interface for these digital agents. 

The C2W2 agents are designed to emerge entirely from this paradigm shift... 

Agents & Avatars 

Page 39

Just as an AI that recommends meditation cannot meditate itself, the resonance left in the viewer at the end is visceral. 

The digital genesis yields an essential, human truth: The audience can only click, and watch.

Quick Recap 

Page 43

Click to wear avatars. Oh my lord. Back in november 23, i remember, how all came together under the armature of runway. Now it is different. 2025. This is more of a statement, a digital poetry, a nasty screenshot of who we are as civilization, or as the bubble we live in, located besides codes and algorithms, no faces, no mimics, only texts. 

This isn't just a show. it's a monumental roar that'll echo through eternity. Not here to parade pixels or chase aesthetics. It is only the ghost facade. 

We're here because something deeper is cooking a towering hymn to human culture that refuses to be silent. 

In here, we're just files. Numbers. Data points dancing. No bodies, no boundaries, no binaries. Pure human frequency encoded into forms that pulse with who we really are, Files don't have genders. 

Code doesn't have race. Math doesn't give a fuck about your flesh. 

Each creation here is a being, an ideology smashing through the divide between organic and virtual, in a form of walking cool, memes, forged by culture. 

Everything here is a meme because everything real is a meme. 

Fuck metaverse. That was half ass you. This is for the entities being born in networks right now, digital souls seeking avatars to dream in. Agents, born in net. 

Used to called bots, now fancier, and they're one of us. 

Someday, we all will look back at this moment the way we stare at ancient temples. 

I'm just the messenger, childishly curating a palette of tools so high it teeters on the edge of madness. No answers, no feelings. I am you, this is you, your life, your medium, your monument. 

Welcome to the existence. Click to be.
