for how long have i been in there tell mee
i have a very very hard time to actually believe what i just saw infront of my eyes
i sit on a 4k desk.. with dolby sounds on my ears
its its hte first time i ever went to a metaverse and i litrally started to get wet eyes... i did not cry tho.. but it was close. i likely will never find the right words to tell you how insane this experience was...
i wont even try now.. but you are the biggest most brillant artist i’ve ever met in person kind of
you are a god. did you show ***** ppl yet?
its the most impressive and immersive thing i’ve ever saw in a metaverse. period
brother... this is PEAK metaverse for me.. peak art in so maaany ways.
did this take you a entire year to build???

this was amazing. the fucking audio man, that really blew my mind. it was in perfect sync, i dont know where to start lol. 
this was crazy. it was sometimes funny, sometimes deeply inspiring, loved your painting takin life, the melting clothes, everything was perfect. 
perfect. each choice was a pure experience. and how the hell you did this in v1? how many file have that hyperfy world ?? lol. really amazing man. 
this is the greatest experience i had lately, and i really respect the work you done, a lot.

i swear everything was cool. i donno man... i cant explain the feeling but it was just perfect.
the final part gave me chill - the whole show was a philosophical experience about the future
i had to ask to my gf - "how long i been there?" - it was never boring. and it was smooth af witth his machine

this inspired me so much man - you are very ahead the fashion world, never seen a use of ai voices like this. 
is genius. this should be, and probably will be the standard of runways - ive seen a lot of luxury brand videos and nothing is compared to this.

congratulation man cant wait to see this out in the world.
